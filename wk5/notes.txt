Pipeline hazards:
    1. Structural hazard - resource contention
        Fix: Add more resources.
    2. Data hazard - instructions dependency
        Fix: Feedback
    3. Branch hazard - If/else, loops, switch function calls, goto, return
        Fix: ?
    4. Memory hazard -  Memory is very slow
        Fix: Cache  

How to fix branch hazards
    1. Ignore it, but branches are 15% to 25% of code
    2. Predict where it will go
        a. Random - flip a coin
        b. Hints - Intel pentium 
        c. Predict always taken         } Static
           Predict always not taken     } Prediction
        d. Forwards always not taken
           Backwards always taken
        e. Profile driven execution
            Predict if taken last time, it will be taken again
        h. Neural networks
